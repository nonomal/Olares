>*The modern internet built on public clouds is increasingly threatening your personal data privacy. As reliance on services like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Facebook grows, so does the risk to your digital autonomy. Your data lives on their servers, subject to their terms, tracking, and potential censorship.*

>*It's time for a change.* 

![Personal Cloud](https://file.bttcdn.com/github/olares/public-cloud-to-personal-cloud.jpg)

Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, SD WebUI for image generation, and Mastodon for building censor free social space. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.
