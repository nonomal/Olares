# Network

Olares provides users with a barrier-free but secure and versatile network solutions. This documents covers the key networking concepts related to application access.

## Entrance

Each Olares application can have one or more entrances that serve as access points. There are three types of entrances:

- **Public entrance**

  - Provides external services such as blogs, social media, etc.
  - Accessible without authentication
  - Basic security through Cloudflare

- **Private entrance**

  - Provides services exclusively for individual users, families, or teams
  - Suitable for readers, entertainment, productivity tools, desktop applications, etc.
  - Requires [authentication](account.md#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) for access

- **Internal entrance**
  - Functions similarly to private entrance
  - No authentication required when accessing applications through LarePass VPN

## Acccess to private entrances via VPN

Simply enable [LarePass VPN](/manual/larepass/private-network.md) on your device to securely and quickly access your private applications via their dedicated URLs (e.g., `https://vault.alice123.olares.com`).

::: tip Note
If LarePass VPN is not enabled, requests to your private entrances will be routed through your reverse proxy tunnel to Olares, which may cause network latency and incur charges.
:::

## Endpoints

An endpoint is the access address or point where users interact with an application. Simply put, it's the URL you enter in your browser's address bar to access a specific Olares application or its features.

A typical Olares application endpoint follows this format:

    https://{routeID}.{domain}

For example: `https://vault.alice123.olares.com`, where

- `vault` is the route ID for a system application.
- `alice123.olares.com` is derived from the Olares ID `alice123@olares.com`.

## Route ID

A route ID is a unique identifier used to identify specific applications or application entrances. The default route IDs are automatically generated by the system according to the following rules:

- System applications
  - Use predefined memorable Route IDs
  - Examples: `desktop` (for Desktop), `market` (for Market)
- Community applications
  - Use an 8-character random string + entrance index (starting from 0)
  - Example: For an application with Route ID 92d76a13 and two entrances, the first entrance is `92d76a130`, and the access URL is `92d76a130.bob.olares.com`

::: tip Note

- The URL of the application is derived from Olares ID.
- Entrance index refers to the position of entrance in multiple entrances defined in [`OlaresManifest.yaml`](../../developer/develop/package/manifest.md).

## Olares internal network

Olares implements a layered proxy routing design in its gateway architecture. Traffic flows through multiple layers:

`cluster` -> `user` -> `application` -> `service component`.

Inside the application, Olares has multiple layers of security.

- **Namespace isolation**

  - Each application operates in its exclusive namespace
  - All resources are namespace-confined
  - Applications cannot connect `ClusterRole` to `ServiceAccount`
  - Cross-namespace resource access is prohibited

- **Network policy controls**
  - Each namespace has dedicated network policies
  - Incoming network requests are restricted to cluster applications and system applications of the user
  - User-level network isolation:
    - Applications isolated between users
    - Third-party applications isolated within user space
- **Pod restrictions**
  - Pods cannot use `hostNetwork` service or `NodePort` service
  - Traffic access requires declared entrance service and system-provided entry proxy
  - The Pod declared as entrance will be forced to join Envoy's sandbox Sidecar to authenticate and authorize incoming traffic.
