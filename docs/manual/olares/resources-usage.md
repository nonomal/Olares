# Monitor system and application status
The Dashboard app in Olares provides a centralized and intuitive view of your system's status, offering deep insights without requiring extensive technical expertise. From the dashboard, you can monitor key resource usage patterns and access detailed real-time metrics across your cluster.

## Access monitoring dashboards

View your system's status through these specialized dashboards:
- **Overview**: Shows current resource usage and system health.
- **Applications**: Displays running applications and their status.

## Overview

The Overview page provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of your Olares system's health and resource utilization. It is divided into key sections to help you monitor performance effectively:

- Cluster's physical resources
- User resource usage
- Usage ranking

### View physical resources

Monitor the fundamental resource metrics directly from the **Cluster's physical resource** dashboard:

- CPU utilization
- Memory consumption
- Disk usage
- Pod status
- GPU usage
- Network status

#### Pods panel
The Pods panel offers a dynamic view of your application's deployment status.

To access it, click the **Pods** card on the **Cluster's physical resources** dashboard.

![Pods panel](/images/manual/olares/dashboard-pods.png#bordered)

This panel displays real-time graphs showing the number of running pods over time for different nodes in the cluster. (e.g., "Olares" and "Olares2").

#### GPU panel

The **GPU** panel provides in-depth information about your GPUs within the cluster. Use this panel to effectively monitor GPU health, resource allocation, and performance across your cluster. 

To access it, click the GPU card on the **Cluster's physical resources** dashboard.

![GPU panel](/images/manual/olares/dashboard-gpu-overview.png#bordered)

This panel includes two tabs: 

- **Graphics management tab**: View a list of all detected GPUs, including their GPU ID, model, GPU mode (e.g., Memory Slicing), host node, health status, computing power usage, VRAM usage rate, and power draw.
  
  For a more granular view of a specific GPU, click **View details** next to its entry.

- **Task management tab**: Monitor tasks currently using your GPUs. It provides insights into the task name, status, GPU Mode, host node, computing power usage, and VRAM used, along with available operations.

#### Network panel

The Network panel provides comprehensive insights into your network interfaces. Use this panel to monitor network connectivity, traffic flow, and configuration for optimal system performance.

To access it, click the **Network** card on the **Overview** dashboard.

![Network panel](/images/manual/olares/dashboard-network.png#bordered)

The Network panel displays:

- Network port information: Details for each network port (e.g., wlo1), including its usage status, real-time upload and download speeds, and connection status.

- IP configuration: Information on IP acquisition method (e.g., DHCP), host node, and network configuration.

- IPv4 and IPv6 details: Comprehensive details for both IPv4 and IPv6, including address, subnet mask, gateway address, DNS, and network status.

#### Access detailed resource metrics 

Click **More details** on the top right of the **Overview** dashboard to view dynamic monitoring data over a specific period of time.

Use the dropdown menu in the top right to change the time range, or click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">refresh</i> to update monitoring data.

The following metrics help you maintain optimal system performance:

### Check user resource quota
You can view your resource quota allocated by the Olares admin.

![Resource quota](/images/manual/olares/resource-quota.png#bordered)

:::warning
When your resource quota runs low, you may experience:

* Slower system performance.
* Inability to install new applications.
* Automatic suspension of resource-intensive applications.
:::


### Track application performance
The **Usage ranking** section displays the top 5 applications consuming CPU and memory resources. To access the complete list of application resource usage, click **More**.

![Usage ranking](/images/manual/olares/usage-ranking.png#bordered)

## Applications

The **Applications** dashboard helps you monitor resource usage patterns across your applications through various sorting and filtering options.

Use the dropdown menu in the upper right corner to sort applications based on their resource consumption:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Inbound traffic
- Outbound traffic

![Applications](/images/manual/olares/applications.png#bordered)

Toggle between ascending and descending order to identify which applications are consuming the most or least resources.

For applications supporting multiple entrances (such as Wordpress), you can click icons to switch between different entrance types and view their corresponding resource metrics.
![Multiple entrances](/images/manual/olares/multiple-entrances.png){width=40%}
:::tip
* When your application list grows large, quickly locate specific applications by typing their names in the search box at the top of the page.
* Regularly checking resource consumption patterns helps you identify applications that might need optimization or attention.
