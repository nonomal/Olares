When downloading multiple files, the behavior differs between the Files in Olares and LarePass desktop application.
* **Files in Olares (web interface)**: Download tasks are managed directly in your browser. Manage the download queue, pause, resume, or cancel a download in the download manager of the browser. 
* **LarePass desktop**: Downloads are queued in LarePass, allowing you to pause, resume, or cancel tasks, and easily locate downloaded files.
:::tip Notes
- Folder download is only supported in LarePass desktop.
