# Manage resource configurations

This guide explains how to view and manage resource configurations in Olares using Control Hub. You can access resources in two ways:

- **Namespaces view**: Focused on resources within a specific namespace (e.g., Secrets, ConfigMaps, Service Accounts, Services).
- **Resources view**: Aggregated by type across the cluster (e.g., Storage, Network, Jobs, CRDs).

## Namespace view

Under each namespace, you can find resources such as Secrets, ConfigMaps, Service Accounts, and Services.

### View Secrets

The Secrets section stores sensitive data like passwords, credentials, and key configurations. In Kubernetes, this data is Base64 encoded by default. 

To view Secrets:

1. In the left navigation, click **Browse**.
2. In the **Browse** panel, expand the target namespace.
3. In the second column, click to expand **Secrets**, then select an item to view details.

  ![Secrets](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-secrets.png#bordered)

Details include:
- **Info**: Cluster, namespace, creation time, and secret type.
- **Data**: Key/value pairs (values shown in Base64 by default. Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">visibility</i> button to decode).

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_square</i> button in the top-right corner to edit the YAML configuration of the secret.

### View ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps stores environment variables, startup parameters, and configuration files for the namespace. Its structure is similar to Secrets. However, the content is saved in plaintext.

To view ConfigMaps:

1. In the left navigation, click **Browse**.
2. In the **Browse** panel, expand the target namespace.
3. In the second column, click to expand **ConfigMaps**, then select an item to view details.

  ![ConfigMaps](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-configmap.png#bordered)

Details include:
- **Info**: Namespace, creation time.
- **Data**: Config keys and values (stored in plain text).

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_square</i> button in the top-right corner to edit the YAML configuration of ConfigMaps.


### View Service Accounts

Service Accounts is a Kubernetes mechanism to authenticate container applications, enabling their access to cluster resources managed by Kubernetes.

Each Service Account is linked to a Secret. This Secret includes the Service Account's `CA certificate`, `Namespace`, and `Token`.

To view Service Accounts:

1. In the left navigation, click **Browse**.
2. In the **Browse** panel, expand the target namespace.
3. In the second column, click to expand **Service Accounts**, then select an item to view details.

  ![Service accounts](/images/how-to/olares/controlhub/browse/13.jpg#bordered)

Details include:
- **Info**: Basic information such as namespace and creation time.
- **Data**: Key/value pairs of the secret linked to this service account.
- **KubeConfig settings**: The KubeConfig configuration automatically generated by this Service Account. Developers can download this configuration and incorporate it into an application within the container. Alternatively, an application in the container can read the Service Account configuration injected by Kubernetes at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/`.

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_square</i> button in the top-right corner to edit the YAML configuration of the service account.

### View Services

Services expose network applications running on a single or a group of Pods as network services. They distribute traffic based on defined Selectors.

A Selector uses Labels to filter Pods. Essentially, a Service acts as a virtual IP (VIP) that directs traffic to a single Pod or a group of Pods.

To view Services:

1. In the left navigation, click **Browse**.
2. In the **Browse** panel, expand the target namespace.
3. In the second column, click to expand **Services**, then select an item to view details.

![Services](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-service.png#bordered)

Details include:
- **Properties**: Namespace, creation time, selector, virtual IP, etc.
- **Workloads**: Workloads selected by the service.
- **Ports**: All exposed ports.
- **Pods**: Selected Pods and their status.
- **Labels/Annotations**: Metadata for the service.
- **Events**: Related system events.

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">edit_square</i> buttons in the top-right corner to:

- **Edit YAML**: Change the Service configuration by editing its YAML file.
- **Edit external access**: Set the method for accessing the service from outside the cluster.

## Resources view

Beyond namespace-specific entries, you can also view resource configurations by type in the **Resources** section. This section aggregates cluster resources by category, providing cross-namespace comparison and cluster-level troubleshooting. Supported types include:

| Resource type   | Description                                                                     | Common use cases                                        |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage**     | Lists all Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) <br/>for managing application storage. | Debug mounts, check quotas, or troubleshoot storage     |
| **Network**     | Displays namespace network policies that<br/> define ingress/egress rules.      | Troubleshoot entrance connectivity or validate security |
| **Jobs**        | Manage one-time or scheduled (Cron) tasks,<br/> track execution history.             | Monitor scheduled tasks or review job runs              |
| **CRDs**        | Lists all Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions<br/> powering Olares features.      | Inspect system extensibility or debug CRDs              |

### Manage Storage Volumes

Navigate to **Resources** > **Storage** in the left sidebar to view the list of persistent volume claims (PVCs) in your Olares cluster. You can filter PVCs by namespaces, status, or search by name.

![Storage](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-pvc.png#bordered)

PVC details include:
- **Name**: The unique identifier of the PVC.
- **Status**: The PVC status, including Bound, Lost, and Pending.
- **Access mode**: Common modes are ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteMany (RWX) 
- **Mount status**: Whether the volume is mounted to a pod.
- **Creation time**: The time when the PVC was created.

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">more_vert</i> icon on the right side of a PVC entry to perform these actions:
- **Edit Info**: Modify the PVC's metadata, such as its name or labels.
- **Edit YAML**: Edit the PVC's configuration in the YAML editor.

:::warning Caution
Editing or deleting PVCs may affect dependent applications or cause data loss. Proceed carefully.
:::

### View Network Policies

Navigate to **Resources** > **Network** in the left sidebar to access the network policy details page for a specific namespace.

![Network](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-network.png#bordered)

- **Ingress rules**: Only allow traffic to enter from Pods within the same namespace that match the specified conditions in the label-matching rules.

  - Within a single rule: All label conditions use `AND` logic and must be met.
  - Between rules: Multiple rules use `OR` logic, and traffic is allowed if it satisfies any one of the rules.

- **Egress rules**: The logic is similar to ingress rules; used to control which traffic is allowed to leave the namespace.

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">visibility</i> button in the top-right corner to view the YAML definition of the policy.

### View Jobs

Navigate to **Resources** > **Jobs** in the left sidebar to view the execution history, scheduling, and status of both one-time and cron (scheduled) jobs within your cluster.

### View CRDs
Navigate to **Resources** > **Jobs** in the left sidebar to access the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) page.

![CRDs](/images/manual/olares/controlhub-crd.png#bordered)

For each CRD, you can see:
- **Details**: Basic info such as name, group, scope, and creation time. There are two types of CRD scopes.
  - **Namespace**: Custom resources belong to a namespace.
  - **Cluster**: Custom resources are unique at the cluster level (e.g., Namespace itself).
- **Custom Resources**: A list of all resources under the CRD, including names and creation times.

Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">more_vert</i> button on the right side of the custom resource entry to perform these actions:

- **Edit YAML**: Edit the custom resource's configuration in the YAML editor.
- **Delete**: Delete the custom resource.
