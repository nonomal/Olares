# Vault basics
This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of using Vault, from setting up your first vault to organizing your sensitive data efficiently.

## Understand Vault components

### Types of vault
Olares Vault offers two main types of vaults for users:

* Main vault (**My vault**): Automatically created upon account activation, serving as the user's private vault. It's encrypted with the user's mnemonic for maximum security.
* Shared vault (**Team vault**): These are collaborative vaults within Olares, allowing secure information sharing among team members or family.

### Vault items
Think of vault items as individual secure containers for your sensitive information. Each vault item consists of several components:

* **Name**: A title for easy identification
* **Tags**: For organization and quick filtering
* **Fields**: Various data types to store different kinds of information
* **History**: Tracks changes made to the item
* **Attachments**: For adding related files
* **Expiration**: Set an expiry date for time-sensitive information

Currently, Vault supports various default types for a vault item:
- Website/App
- Computer
- Credit card
- Bank account
- Wi-Fi Password
- Passport
- Authenticator
- Document

### Fields
Fields are the core component of Vault Items, allowing storage of various data types, including:

* Username
* Password
* Mnemonic
* Email address
* URL
* Date and month
* Credit card number
* Phone number
* PIN
* Plain text
* One-time password (OTP)

## Protect Vault with password
When use Vault in Olares for the first time, you will be prompted to set a local password. This password should not be the same as your Olares login password.

1. Set the local password for Vault.
2. Import the Olares ID that's already linked to your Olares server using mnemonic phrase.
