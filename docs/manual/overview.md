## What is Olares?

Olares is an open-source personal cloud operating system designed to empower you to own and manage your digital assets locally. Instead of relying on public cloud services, you can deploy powerful open-source alternatives locally on Olares, such as Ollama for hosting LLMs, SD WebUI for image generation, and Mastodon for building censor free social space. Imagine the power of the cloud, but with you in complete command.

:::info Open source & monetization model
Olares follows a model similar to **Android**:
- The **Olares OS** (the software) is fully **open source**, ensuring transparency, community collaboration, and extensibility. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/beclab/Olares).
- The **hardware** (devices running Olares) can be licensed and distributed by manufacturers, enabling sustainable growth through hardware offerings and ecosystem partnerships.
