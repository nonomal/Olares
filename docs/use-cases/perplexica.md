# Perplexica

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered search engine that provides intelligent search capabilities while maintaining user privacy. As an alternative to Perplexity AI, it combines advanced machine learning with comprehensive web search functionality to deliver accurate, source-cited answers to your queries.

## The backend: SearSNG
SearXNG serves as the privacy-focused meta-search engine backend for Perplexica. It:
* Aggregates results from multiple search engines
* Removes tracking and preserves your privacy
* Provides clean, unbiased search results for the AI model to process

This integration enables Perplexica to function as a complete search solution while maintaining the security of your sensitive information.

## Before you begin
Before getting started, ensure you have:
- Ollama installed and running in your Olares environment
