description: Deploy a cloud Android emulator using redroid on Olares, and access the Android host from macOS and Windows via adb and scrcpy.
---

# Host your cloud Android with redroid

[redroid](https://github.com/remote-android/redroid-doc) (Remote Android) is a GPU-accelerated Android-in-Cloud (AIC) solution that integrates seamlessly with Olares. You can easily host high-performance Android instances on your Olares and access them anytime to run Android games, apps, or even automation tests.

This tutorial walks you through installing redroid on Olares and accessing the Android instance from Windows and macOS.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:
- Install the required Linux kernel modules on the Olares host.
- Install the redroid app on Olares and get the service URL.
- Connect and operate the Android instance from Windows and macOS, using `adb` and `scrcpy`.
- Install APK apps on the Android instance.

## Before you begin

Make sure the following requirements are met:
- Olares is installed and running on a Linux machine.
    ::: tip Configuration requirements
    - redroid is only supported on Linux. Make sure your Olares instance is running on a Linux system.
    - redroid is resource-intensive. For best performance, we recommend using a machine with at least an 8-core CPU and 16GB of RAM.
    :::

- Your device and Olares are on the same local network.

    :::tip Remote access
    If your device is on a different network, use [LarePass](https://olares.com/larepass) to enable a private network connection to Olares.
    :::

## Install dependent kernel modules

redroid requires specific kernel modules to run on Linux. For details, refer to the [official redroid docs](https://github.com/remote-android/redroid-doc/blob/master/deploy/README.md).

For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the required kernel modules by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install linux-modules-extra-`uname -r`
sudo modprobe binder_linux devices="binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"
# This command might fail on newer kernels; the error can be safely ignored.
sudo modprobe ashmem_linux
```

## Install redroid on Olares

redroid runs as a headless backend on Olares. To install redroid:

1. In Olares Market, find redroid under "Utilities", and click **Get**. redroid will launch automatically after installation.

2. Get the URL to access the redroid service:

    a. From Olares Desktop, navigate to **Settings** > **Application** > **redroid**.

    b. In **Entrances** > **Set up endpoint**, get the base domain of redroid, e.g., `beb583c3.<olares_id>.olares.com`.

    c. Append the exported port of redroid (`46878`) to the base domain.

    As redroid only allows local access, the domain should also include `.local`. Here is an example of our final URL to access the redroid service: `beb583c3.local.olares01.olares.com:46878`.

## Connect to the redroid service

To access the Android instance on Olares, you'll need to connect to the redroid service using `adb` and render the UI using `scrcpy`.

<tabs> 
<template #Windows>
 
 The Windows version comes bundled with `adb`, so you don't need to install it separately.

1. Download the Windows version of `scrcpy` from the [project website](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/windows.md) and extract it to a specific folder.

    ::: tip adb version conflict
    If another version of `adb` is installed, it may cause conflicts between `adb` servers. Uninstall the old version or replace it with the bundled version in `scrcpy`.
    :::

2. Open PowerShell, then navigate to the `scrcpy` directory:

    ```powershell
    # Replace with the acutal path
    cd .\scrcpy-win64-v3.1
    ```

3. Use `adb` to connect to the redroid service via the URL obtained earlier:

    ```powershell
    .\adb.exe connect beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878
    ```

    The connection is successful if you see the example output:

    ```powershell
    # Example output
    already connected to beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878
    ```

4. Render UI and audio using `scrcpy`:

    ```powershell
    .\scrcpy.exe -s beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878 --audio-codec=aac --audio-encoder=OMX.google.aac.encoder
    ````
    
    Upon successful execution, the command line outputs the device and rendering info. And the Android screen pops up.

</template>
<template #macOS>

On macOS, `scrcpy` does not include `adb` by default, so you'll need to install them separately. It is recommended to install them via Homebrew.

1. Install `scrcpy`:

    ```bash
    brew install scrcpy
    ```

2. Install `adb`:

    ```bash
    brew install --cask android-platform-tools
    ```

3. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    scrcpy --version
    adb version
    ```
    Installation is successful if you see the version numbers.

    :::tip Gatekeeper alert
    If blocked by macOS security, go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Security**, find the corresponding item, and click **Allow Anyway**. You will be promoted to enter your password when re-running the command.
    :::

4. Connect to the redroid service URL obtained earlier via `adb`:

    ```bash
    adb connect beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878
    ```

    The connection is successful if you see the example output.

    ```bash
    # Example output
    already connected to beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878
    ```

5. Render UI and audio using `scrcpy`:

    ```bash
    scrcpy -s beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.cn:46878 --audio-codec=aac --audio-encoder=OMX.google.aac.encoder
    ```
    Upon success, the command line outputs the device information. The Android screen pops up.

## Install APK

Once connected, you can use `adb` to install third-party APK apps on the Android instance. 

<tabs> 
<template #Windows>

1. Get the details of all connected devices: 

    ```powershell
    .\adb.exe devices -l
    ```

    Get the `transport_id` of the device, which is `4` in our case:

    ```powershell 
    # Example output
    List of devices attached
    beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.com:46878 device 
    product:ziyi model:23031PN0DC device:ziyi 
    transport_id:4
    ```

2. Install the APK to the specified device. Use `-t` to specify the transport ID:

    ```powershell
    .\adb.exe -t 4 install C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\your_app.apk\
    ```
    

    The installation is successful if you see the following message:
    
    ```powershell
    # Expected output
    Performing Streamed Install
    Success
    ```
</template>   
<template #macOS>

1. Get the details of all connected devices:

    ```bash
    adb devices -l
    ```

    Get the `transport_id` of the device, which is `4` in our case:

    ```bash 
    # Example output
    List of devices attached
    beb583c3.local.<olares_id>.olares.com:46878 device 
    product:ziyi model:23031PN0DC device:ziyi 
    transport_id:4
    ```

2. Install the APK to the specified device. Use `-t` to specify the transport ID:

    ```bash
    adb -t 4  install ~/Downloads/your_app.apk
    ```
    
    The installation is successful if you see the following message:
    
    ```bash
    # Expected output
    Performing Streamed Install
    Success
    ```

</template>  
</tabs>

After installation, run `scrcpy` again to render the Android screen. Swipe up to see the installed APK.

## Common `adb` commands

:::tip Note
The following commands are for macOS and Linux. On Windows, replace `adb` with `adb.exe`.
:::

```bash
# Start adb server
adb start-server

# Connect to a device
adb connect <url>:<port>

# List connected devices
adb devices
