2. Go to the **Compatibility** tab and check **Enable Steam Play for all other titles**.

## Configure the streaming service

Steam Headless also integrates Sunshine, the streaming server. To stream games using Moonlight, you need to pair the host PC on moonlight with Sunshine. 

### Prepare for paring

1. From your Steam client in the browser, get the URL and append `:47990`, for example, `https://139ebc4f0.local.<your Olares ID>.olares.com:47990`. Open this URL to access the Sunshine console page.

2. On your first visit, log in using the default credentials:  
   - Username: `sam`  
   - Password: `password` 

3. Click the **Pin** tab to open the pairing page, where you will be prompted to enter the pairing code.

### Add host in Moonlight

1. Open the Moonlight client on your streaming device and click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">add_to_queue</i> button in the top-right corner.

2. When promoted to enter the IP address of your host PC, enter the local URL of Steam, for example, `139ebc4f0.local.<your Olares ID>.olares.com`.

   ::: tip Note
   Do not include `https://` and make sure to include the `.local` part in the hostname.
   ::: 

3. Click **OK**, and a host icon appears in locked status.
4. Click the host icon to receive a pairing code.

<!--@include: ./remote.reusables.md{4,22}-->

Once VPN is enabled on your device, simply follow the same instructions as local streaming.

## FAQs

This could be due to your resolution settings. Try adjusting the resolution:
- In Moonlight: adjust in **Settings** > **Basic Settings** > **Resolution and FPS**.
- On the Steam console page: adjust in **Applications** > **Settings** > **Display**.
