# Install Olares on Linux using Docker Compose
You can use Docker to install and run Olares in a containerized environment. This guide walks you through setting up Olares with Docker, preparing the installation environment, completing the activation process, and managing the container lifecycle.

:::tip Recommendation for production use
For best performance and stability, we recommend [installing Olares on Linux via script](/manual/get-started/install-olares.md).
:::

## System requirements

Make sure your device meets the following requirements.

- CPU: At least 4 cores
- RAM: At least 8GB of available memory
- Storage: At least 150GB of available SSD storage. (The installation will fail if an HDD (mechanical hard drive) is used instead of an SSD.)
- Supported systems:
    - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later
    - Debian 11 or later

:::info Version compatibility
While these specific versions are confirmed to work, the process may still work on other versions. Adjustments may be necessary depending on your environment. If you meet any issues with these platforms, feel free to raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/beclab/Olares/issues/new).
:::

## Before you begin
Before you begin, ensure the following:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed and running on your system.
- You know the IP address of the current device.
  :::tip Verify host IP
  To verify your host IP, run the following command in the terminal:
  ```bash
  ip r
  ```
  Look for the line starting with `default via`. It will show the default gateway and the network interface being used.
  :::
- You have [created an Olares ID via LarePass](/manual/get-started/create-olares-id.md).

## Create a new directory
Create a directory to store the Olares configuration files. For example, you could make a new directory called `olares-config` with the following command:

```bash
mkdir ~/olares-config
cd ~/olares-config
```
## Prepare `docker-compose.yaml`
1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `olares-config` directory.
2. Add the appropriate content to the file based on whether GPU support is required:
   :::code-group
   <<< @/code-snippets/docker-compose.yaml
   <<< @/code-snippets/docker-compose-GPU.yaml
   :::
3. Save the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

Here is the updated and properly formatted Markdown content for installing GPU drivers and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, ready to be included in your installation guide:


## Install GPU dependencies (for GPU-enabled machines)

1. Install GPU drivers for your system:

    ```bash
    curl -o /tmp/keyring.deb -L https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb && \
    sudo dpkg -i --force-all /tmp/keyring.deb
    
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nvidia-kernel-open-570
    sudo apt install nvidia-driver-570
    ````

2. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to enable Docker to access your GPU. 
     
     a. Configure the repository:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | \
      sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg
    
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
      sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    
    sudo sed -i -e '/experimental/ s/^#//g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
    
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

      b. Install the toolkit and restart docker:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
   sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

      c. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
   ```

    If successful, you should see output similar to the following:

    ```

    +-----------------------------------------+------------------------+----------------------+
    ```


## Set up environment variables and start container

1. In the `olares-config` directory, use the following command to set the environment variables and start the Olares services:

   ```bash [With Docker Compose Plugin]
   VERSION=<olares version> HOST_IP=<host ip> docker compose up -d
   ```
   - `VERSION=<olares version>`: Specifies the Olares version. Replace `<olares version>` with the actual one. For example: `1.11.5`.
   - `HOST_IP=<host ip>`: Specifies the Linux machine's IP address. Replace `<host ip>` with the actual one.
   
   After executing the command, you should see output similar to the following, showing the status and port mappings of all containers:
    ```bash

2. Verify if the container is running successfully:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   You should see an output like this:
   ```bash

   ```

<!--@include: ./install-and-activate-olares.md-->

## Manage the Olares container
Ensure that you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file before proceeding with any commands.
### Stop the container
To stop the running container:
```bash
docker compose stop
```

### Restart the container
To restart the container after it has been stopped:
```bash
docker compose start
```
It may take 6 to 7 minutes for all services to fully initialize after restarting.

### Uninstall the container
To uninstall the container:
```bash
docker compose down
```
